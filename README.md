# Pascal’s Triangle (C)
A simple C program that generates Pascal’s Triangle using nested loops and basic arithmetic. This project was created as part of my university coursework to practice control structures, nested iteration, and terminal output formatting.

# Features
* User inputs the number of rows to generate
* Triangle displayed cleanly in terminal with correct spacing
* Demonstrates mathematical logic using binomial coefficients

---

# Learning Focus
* Looping structures in C
* Console output formatting using printf
* Integer arithmetic
* Understanding Pascal's triangle and its recursive nature
